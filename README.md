# Cat_or_Dog_Image_Classification
Cat_or_Dog_Image_Classification is a deep learning project using Keras to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies images as either a cat or a dog. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images of cats and dogs, achieving a training accuracy of 88.35% and a testing accuracy of 67.50%. While current results show promising performance, further improvements in accuracy are expected with the use of larger and more diverse datasets.
